## Create Team

### Objective

Verify that the TeamHub team creation process works correctly for users who selected "Coach/Manager" in the registration wizard. This includes validating the club unique code input, successful team creation under an existing club, and error handling for invalid codes.

### Prerequisites

- A TeamHub account registered as a Coach/Manager (use the registration process from previous tests if needed).
- Access to the TeamHub application (URL: [insert application URL]).
- At least one pre-created club with a known unique 8-character alphanumeric code (e.g., "ABC123XY" for a valid club).
- An invalid club code for testing (e.g., "INVALID1").
- Test environment with clubs manually created and assigned codes.

### Test Case 1: Successful Team Creation with Valid Club Code

#### Log In as Coach/Manager

- Open the TeamHub application in a web browser.
- Log in using credentials for a Coach/Manager account.
- Verify the dashboard loads with coach-specific features (e.g., team management options).

#### Navigate to Team Creation Page

- From the dashboard, locate and click the "Create Team" or equivalent button (e.g., under "Teams" menu).
- Verify the team creation form appears, including a field for the club unique code.

#### Enter Valid Club Code and Team Details

- Input the valid 8-character club code (e.g., "ABC123XY").
- Fill in other required team details (e.g., team name like "Youth Soccer Team", age group, sport type â€“ assume standard fields if not specified).
- Verify the form validates inputs (e.g., no errors on valid data).

#### Submit Team Creation

- Click the "Create Team" or "Submit" button.
- Verify a success message appears (e.g., "Team created successfully under club [Club Name]").
- Confirm the team is listed in the dashboard or club-associated teams, and is linked to the correct club.

### Test Case 2: Team Creation with Invalid Club Code

#### Log In and Navigate

- Repeat steps 1-2 from Test Case 1 to reach the team creation form.

#### Enter Invalid Club Code

- Input an invalid 8-character code (e.g., "INVALID1").
- Fill in other required team details as in Test Case 1.

#### Submit and Verify Error

- Click the "Create Team" or "Submit" button.
- Verify an error message appears: "A club with code [INVALID1] can not be found."
- Confirm no team is created, and the form remains editable for corrections.

### Test Case 3: Edge Cases and Validations (Optional)

#### Invalid Code Format

- Attempt to input a code shorter than 8 characters (e.g., "ABC12").
- Verify form validation prevents submission or shows an error (e.g., "Code must be 8 alphanumeric characters").

#### Non-Alphanumeric Code

- Input a code with special characters (e.g., "ABC123!@").
- Verify an error for invalid format.

#### Empty Code Field

- Leave the club code field blank.
- Attempt submission and verify a required field error.

#### Case Sensitivity (If Applicable)

- If codes are case-sensitive, test with mixed case (e.g., "AbC123Xy" vs. "abc123xy").
- Verify behavior matches expected (success or error based on club data).

### Expected Outcomes

- Valid club code results in team creation under the specified club.
- Invalid club code triggers the exact error message without creating a team.
- Form validations handle input errors appropriately.
- No unauthorized access or creation for non-Coach/Manager users (test by attempting with a Parent/Guardian account if available).

### Notes

- Record any deviations (e.g., UI issues, unexpected errors) with screenshots and logs.
- Test across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (desktop, mobile) for compatibility.
- Ensure clubs are pre-created manually in the test environment before running these tests.
- Update placeholders (e.g., URLs, codes, field names) with your actual app details.
- If additional team fields are required (e.g., team logo, description), incorporate them into the steps as needed.

- Confirm the post appears in the team's "Recent Posts" section on the Coach/Manager dashboard.

#### Create Post at Character Limit

- Create another post with a 1000-character message (e.g., generate a lorem ipsum text or repeat a phrase to reach exactly 1000 characters).
- Click "Submit" or "Post."
- Verify the post is created successfully and appears in the "Recent Posts" section.

### Test Case 2: Parent/Guardian Viewing and Marking Post as Read

#### Log In as Parent/Guardian

- Open the TeamHub application in a new browser session.
- Log in using Parent/Guardian account credentials with a player on "TEAM123X" (e.g., "John Smith").
- Verify the dashboard loads with parent-specific features (e.g., "Recent Posts" section).

#### Verify Post Visibility

- Navigate to the dashboard or team section for "TEAM123X."
- Verify both posts (e.g., the reminder and 1000-character post) appear in the "Recent Posts" section.
- Confirm the posts are marked as "Unread" (e.g., highlighted, bolded, or with an unread indicator).

#### Mark Post as Read

- For the first post (e.g., "Reminder: Practice tomorrow..."), locate and click a "Mark as Read" or equivalent button/link.
- Verify the post's status changes to "Read" (e.g., highlight removed, status updated to "Read").
- Confirm the second post remains "Unread."

#### Mark Second Post as Read

- Click "Mark as Read" for the 1000-character post.
- Verify the status changes to "Read" and is updated visually on the dashboard.

### Test Case 3: Edge Cases and Validations (Optional)

#### Exceeding Character Limit

- As Coach/Manager, attempt to submit a post with 1001 characters.
- Verify an error appears (e.g., "Post exceeds 1000-character limit") and submission is prevented.

#### Empty Post

- Attempt to submit a post with no text.
- Verify an error appears (e.g., "Post content is required") or submission is blocked.

#### Non-Associated Parent/Guardian

- Log in with a Parent/Guardian account with a player not on "TEAM123X" (e.g., on "TEAM789Y").
- Verify the posts for "TEAM123X" do not appear in their "Recent Posts" section.

#### Multiple Players in Team

- Log in with a Parent/Guardian account with multiple players in "TEAM123X" (e.g., "John Smith" and "Emma Smith").
- Verify the posts appear once in the dashboard (not duplicated per player).
- Mark a post as read and confirm the status applies for the account, not per player.

#### Read Status Persistence

- Log out and log back in as the Parent/Guardian.
- Verify the marked "Read" posts retain their status, and unread posts remain unchanged.

### Expected Outcomes

- Coach/Manager can create posts up to 1000 characters, which appear in the "Recent Posts" section for team-associated users.
- Parent/Guardian users with players in the team see posts marked as "Unread" initially.
- Parent/Guardian can mark posts as "Read," updating the status visually and persistently.
- Posts are only visible to users with players in the team ("TEAM123X").
- Validations prevent invalid post submissions (e.g., exceeding character limit or empty posts).

### Notes

- Record deviations (e.g., UI issues, incorrect read status) with screenshots and logs.
- Test across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (desktop, mobile) for compatibility.
- Ensure the team ("TEAM123X") and associated players exist in the test environment.
- Update placeholders (e.g., URLs, team codes, post content) with actual app details.
- Verify that only Coach/Manager accounts can create posts, and only Parent/Guardian accounts with team-associated players can view/mark them.
